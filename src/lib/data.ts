  history: "The Mahalaxmi Temple of Kolhapur is one of the oldest and most significant temples in India. It is believed to have been originally built during the Chalukya period (7th century CE). The temple has been renovated and expanded over centuries by various dynasties including the Shilahara, Yadava, and Maratha rulers. It is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas and holds immense importance in Hindu tradition.",
  architecture: "The temple showcases a blend of Hemadpanthi and Chalukyan architectural styles. The main sanctum houses the idol of Goddess Mahalaxmi adorned with precious ornaments. The temple complex includes multiple shrines, a large courtyard, and beautifully carved pillars and ceilings.",
  festivals: "Navratri (Ghatasthapana to Dussehra) is the grandest festival celebrated here with immense devotion. Lalita Panchami, Ashtami, and Khande Navami are especially significant. Other major festivals include Kojagiri Pournima, Diwali, and the annual Kirnotsav (rays of sun falling directly on the deity).",
  significance: "The idol of Mahalaxmi is believed to be self-manifested (Swayambhu). The temple is one of the six Mahalaxmi temples and is considered the most important. The annual Kirnotsav, where the rays of the setting sun fall directly on the face of the idol, is a unique natural phenomenon observed in January and November.",
